<h2 style="color:red">WHAT IS ABORTION?</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">Abortion is the expulsion of a fetus from the uterus before it reached the stage of viability. 
Usually it is until 20 weeks age of gestation. An abortion may occur spontaneously, or what 
we call spontaneous or miscarriages. It may also be brought purposely, often called an 
induced abortion. Spontaneous abortions, or miscarriages, occur for many reasons, including 
disease, trauma, genetic defect, or biochemical incompatibility of mother and fetus.</p>
<p2 style="text-align:justify">Occasionally a fetus dies in the uterus but fails to be expelled, a condition termed a missed 
abortion. According to Philippine statistics the unintended pregnancy rate declined 33 
percent between 1990-1994 and 2015-2019 increased 51 percent. The share of unintended 
pregnancies ending in abortion rose from 22 percent to 51 percent.</p2>

<br>
<h3 style="text-align:left">1.Missed Abortion</h3>
<p style="text-align:left">Missed abortion is when a pregnancy stops developing, where the embryo/fetus/embryonic tissue or empty gestation sac remains in the uterus and the cervical os is closed. Symptoms may include pain, bleeding or no symptoms at all.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left">2.Threatened Abortion</h3>
<p style="text-align:left">A threatened abortion occurs when a pregnant patient at less than 20 weeks gestation presents with vaginal bleeding. The cervical os is closed on a physical exam. The patient may also experience abdominal cramping, pelvic pain, pelvic pressure, and/or back pain.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left">3.Inevitable Abortion</h3>
<p style="text-align:left">Inevitable abortion occurs when vaginal bleeding or rupture of membranes occur before 20 weeks gestation in the presence of cervical dilatation. Incomplete abortion typically occurs after 10 weeks gestation when the fetus is expelled and the placenta is retained in the uterus.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left">4.Incomplete Abortion</h3>
<p style="text-align:left">An incomplete abortion is defined as vaginal bleeding during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy with partial expulsion of products of conception.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left">5.Complete Abortion</h3>
<p style="text-align:left"> All of the products (tissue) of conception leave the body.</p>
<h2 style="color:red">WHAT ARE THE CLINICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF ABORTION</h2>
<p style="text-align:left"> with or without pain, including light bleeding called spotting.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"> Pain or cramping in the pelvic area or lower back.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"> Fluid or tissue passing from the vagina.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"> Fast heartbeat.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"> Late spontaneous abortion may begin by sudden gush of fluid when the membranes rupture. Hemorrhage is rarely massive.</p>
<br>
<h2 style="color:red">WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISK FACTORS OF ABORTION?</h2>
<p style="text-align:left"> Extremes of maternal age</p>

<br>
<p style="text-align:left"> A poorly controlled chronic disease (eg, diabetes, hypertension, overt thyroid disorders) 
in the mother.</p>
<br>
<h2 style="color:red">MEDICAL AND NURSING MANAGEMENT</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">For threatened abortion will only be observation. Meanwhile for inevitable, incomplete, or missed abortions it will continous observation or will undergo surgical or medical uterine 
evacuation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">After a spontaneous abortion, parents may feel grief or guilt. They should be given 
emotional support and, in most cases of spontaneous abortions, reassured that their 
actions were not the cause. Formal counselling or support groups may be made available 
if appropriate. Bleeding and cramping may occur, and patients should be counseled about 
when to return to the healthcare facility if symptoms are severe or to confirm passage of 
gestational tissue.
Until 10 to 12 weeks gestation, medical management may be used if spontaneous expulsion 
does not occur or if a patient prefers use of medications to allow a more predictable process. 
A common medication regimen is 800 mcg of misoprostol vaginally; a repeat dose may be 
necessary. Administering 200 mg of mifepristone orally 24 hours before the misoprostol can 
significantly improve treatment success, if mifepristone is available.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The vital signs have to be frequently monitored. All patients should have 2 large-bore IVs and oxygen, even if they initially appear to be stable. Blood must be crossed and typed in cases of bleeding. Always obtain a thorough gynecological and obstetric history so as not to miss any other cause of the symptoms. The rate and amount of bleeding can be easily underestimated especially when the patient is in the supine position. Thus, clinicians should always perform a pelvic exam in a post abortion patient to determine that no blood has collected in the vagina or uterus. The nurse should check the vaginal area for blood. Uterine perforation if missed can be life-threatening. If the patient has abdominal pain post abortion, the gynecologist should be consulted as soon as possible and a CT scan ordered. Some patients may benefit from a diagnostic laparoscopy. In any post-abortion patient, clinicians should never rule out an ectopic pregnancy. If the patient appears septic, broad-spectrum antibiotics need to be started even before the diagnostic workup is complete. Consider the fact that the patient may have retained products of conception, which may be the cause of complications. Bowel injury in post-abortion should be considered; nurses may note that the patient has a tender abdomen with peritoneal signs and should consult with the clinician immediately because if missed, it carries a high mortality. Provide psychological support as the patient may go through anxiety and maintain the confidentiality of the patient.</p>

<h2 style="color:red">PREVENTION AND CONTROL</h2>
<p style="text-align:left"> good sexuality education</p>
<p style="text-align:left"> prevention of unintended pregnancy through use of effective contraception, including 
emergency contraception; and</p>
<p style="text-align:left"> provision of safe, legal abortion.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"> Family planning services in healthcare setting, including counselling on contraceptive 
options.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"> Addressing socioeconomic factors such as tackling poverty, inequality and empowered 
woman to reduce the likelihood of unintended pregnancies.</p>
<p>In addition, deaths and disability from unsafe abortion can be reduced through the timely provision 
of emergency treatment of complication.</p>

<h2 style="color:red">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">Abortion is the termination of pregnancy before it reaches 20 weeks or before or viability. 
Abortion can either be spontaneous (miscarriage) or induced. Signs and symptoms may vary 
depending on the types of spontaneous abortion. Types of miscarriage are threatened spontaneous 
miscarriage, imminent (inevitable) miscarriage, incomplete spontaneous miscarriage, complete 
spontaneous miscarriage, missed miscarriage and recurrent pregnancy loss. In spontaneous 
abortion there is presence of vaginal bleeding with abdominal pain cramping, and the passage of 
tissue. On the other hand in induced abortion can also involve similar symptoms depending on the 
method use. Medical management includes medication, counselling and nursing care for 
monitoring and support. Prevention strategies involve comprehensive sex education, access to 
contraception, and empowerment of women through education and economic opportunities. 
Diagnostic procedures such as pregnancy testing, ultrasound, blood testing, and during abortion 
methods like D&E are important to determine the status of pregnancy, manage potential 
complications and ensuring the safety of the mother. However, the most important thing is to be 
ready before getting pregnant and to always pay attention everything to avoid incidence of trauma 
that can lead to spontaneous miscarriage. It is also important to be well educated regarding this to 
prevent minimal damage. We should always remember that “PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN 
CURE.”</p>
